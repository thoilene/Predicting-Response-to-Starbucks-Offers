# Starbucks-Capstone-Challenge

- This is a project in the context of the Nanodegree program "Data Science"
- It intends to show the ability of the student to apply data science methodology and machine learning techniques in business.

# Requirements
The following libraries have been used for this project under Anaconda distribution:

- Python 3.7.4
- numpy 1.16.5
- pandas 0.25.1
- seaborn 0.9.0
- matplotlib 3.1.1
- sklearn 0.21.3

# Project motivation

AirBnB is an online platform where people can list their space and where travelers can book unique accommodations anywhere in the world. The price paid for accommodation is a central topic for the users of AirBnB (hosts and travelers). In the context of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree I have analyse the prices of AirBnB accommodation in Seattle. Following questions have been answered in this project:

What is the dependency between the number of available listings and times of year?
What is the dependency between AirBnB prices and times of year?
How well can AirBnB prices be predicted?
What are the most important factors for the prediction of AirBnB prices?

# Files in the Repository
