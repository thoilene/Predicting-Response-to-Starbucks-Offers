# Starbucks-Capstone-Challenge

- This is a project in the context of the Nanodegree program "Data Science"
- It intends to show the ability of the student to apply data science methodology and machine learning techniques in business.

# Requirements
The following libraries have been used for this project under Anaconda distribution:

- Python 3.7.4
- numpy 1.16.5
- pandas 0.25.1
- seaborn 0.9.0
- matplotlib 3.1.1
- sklearn 0.21.3

# Project motivation

The Starbucks rewards app allows users to earn rewards when they pay through that app. The process of earning rewards consists of receiving, displaying and completing offers. One important issue concerns the responsiveness of app users who receive offers:

- Could the response of a given user to a given offer be precited ? Will a given user respond to a given offer ?
- What are the most importants factors when it is about to predict the responsiveness of a user to an offer ?

Other questions concerning the business could be adressed in this context as they are closely related to the responsiveness of app users:

- Which are the most accepted offers ?
- Which are the most beneficial offers from the perspective of revenues ?
- What is the profile of the typical/ideal target user (age, income, gender) ?

The answers to these questions could help the company in various ways. By avoiding sending offers to users who are less likely to respond, the company could save advertising costs. This would also allow the company to work more efficiently by targeting those people who are more likely to respond to certain offers.
